# Petshelter
 
Hello There!

This is a Pet shelter.

I decided to make this project after some thoughts in the enterpreurship class. ahah:)
So the point of the project is to keep track of pets in the shelter.

# UPD:
For the project stucture I follewed next stucture:

entity -> repository -> service -> controller

In this case:

I simplified project as much as possible.



# Note:
This project was updated by following previous labs.


# UPD:

Now front-end is available.

Frontend was made with the react framework.

Frontend contains usage of the react redux. with dynamic update.

front location: petshelter -> pets-front.zip

DO:
(npm install, then npm start)

CORS was allowed.

Frontend: https://github.com/Alikhan247/pets
